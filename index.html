    <h1>Describe myself!</h1>
    <p>My name is Innat Ali Suleiman,I study at State university of Zanzibar.I am a lover of codes...I wish one day I would know many programming languages.
       Always, I'm a quiet, introverted teenager who values the positivity of those around me. At times,I prefer to avoid attention and judge people based on their character rather than their appearance.
       I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true.I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to what light I have.Also I am a person who likes to talk to people I know
